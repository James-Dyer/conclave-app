# Charges List Page Plan

This page will provide admins with tools to view and manage all charges in one place. Specific requirements will be expanded later, but the core ideas align with the Members page.

## Initial Concepts

- Display all charges in a table with columns such as Member, Status, Amount, Due Date and Description.
- Use the same Search bar, Sort menu and Filter menu components defined for the Members page so the user experience stays consistent.

## Anticipated Features

1. **Search Bar**
   - Reused component allowing quick lookup of charges by member name, status or description.
2. **Sort Menu**
   - Options may include Due Date, Amount or Status.
3. **Filter Menu**
   - Filter by charge status (Outstanding, Paid, Delinquent) and by member tags or classes once available.

## Next Steps

- Gather further details about charge management tasks in the next planning phase.
- Refine the table columns and filter criteria accordingly.
