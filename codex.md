## Frontend Phases
Phase 1 – Core Member Portal
- Build the minimal UI necessary for members to log in and view their outstanding charges and payment history.
- Display charge statuses (“Delinquent,” “Outstanding,” “Under Review,” “Paid”).
- Allow a member to submit a simple payment review request (with memo field).
- Pages: login, dashboard, charge details, payment review form.
  
Phase 2 – Basic Admin Dashboard
- Add an admin-only section for viewing all members, assigning charges, and reviewing payment confirmation requests.
- Include simple tables or lists for members and charges.
- Provide ability to mark charges as fulfilled or delete them.
  
Phase 3 – Advanced Member & Admin Functions
- Introduce status and tag management (Active, Alumni, etc.).
- Support filtering members or charges by status/tags.
- Implement email/SMS reminders or notifications (if scoped to the web client).
  
Phase 4 – Audit Logs & Full Workflow
- Build interface for audit logs (filter by user, action, date range).
- Polish workflows for editing charges, applying discounts/interest, and so on.
- Integrate advanced admin features such as mass assignments or more complex review processes.
